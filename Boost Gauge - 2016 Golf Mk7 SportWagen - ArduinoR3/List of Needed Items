- Arduino R3 Starter Kit 
- MPX5700AP 
    - Up to 102 psi reading with 2.5% margin of error
    - Find manufacturer transfer equation in the code or the manufacturer datasheet to read pressure values from sensor
    - Pin 1: Vout(data out), Pin 2: Ground, Pin 3: Vin(voltage in)
- BMP 180 barometric pressure sensor
    - Measures outside air pressure to subtract from the MPX5700AP to receive true boost pressure inside the intake manifold of the car 
    - BMP code library for easy pressure, temperature, and altitude readings. 
    - Follows I2C protocol for connection to Arduino
- Your choice of OLED screen 
    - better readability inside of the car 
    - similar code development to LCD display 
    - Follows I2C protocol for connection to Arduino
- 6 feet 1/8" - 5/32" rubber hose to connect to intake manifold port 
- Soldering iron, flux, solder, and helping hands if solo

Some Extra instructions
- Heat up soldering iron and tap into Intake Manifold port 
    -1/2" rubber pipe will fit over manifold port. 
    - Find 1/2" to 1/8" reducer and connect all hoses together. 
- Under the dash and to the left of the steering column you will find a rubber grommet that leads behind the battery 
    - Remove the battery, pop out the grommet and run the 1/8" rubber hose through the firewall and up to the battery 
    - Attach hose to reducer and clamp each connection down so no boost leak occurs 
- Testing the gauge 
    - Before tapping power from the fuse box, test with the 12V power adapter from the car if the boost gauge works properly on a short drive. 
    - If it works proceed to the next step by tapping power from the fuse box 
- Tapping power from fuse box for only when the car is on. 
    - Find a fusebox diagram online for your car and identify which fuses are not being used. 
    - Tap into that fuse by adding an extension and adapting your arduino cylindrical power strip to it. 
    - When the car key is turned on the arduino should power on, but when the car has no power, all accessories should be off. 
- Lastly, package the arduino and gauges as needed

After taking a look at the provided solution and reading about the basics of how AJAX works I have some questions. 

1. After testing the provided solution, I noticed that it took a little bit for results to show up. Is there a faster and more efficient way to show the stored data off the server then the method shown? 

2. How is the flow of data processed after using the fetch() method to retrieve the data to the browser? 

3. And lastly, is the AJAX used in almost all applications in webdev? If not, what are some common applications of AJAX and its processes.
